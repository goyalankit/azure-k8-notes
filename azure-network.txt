IP Address and IP Subnet
------------------------
Every resource that's accessible by network will have IP address. Ip address will reside in an IP Subnet.

- IP Subnet is something we explicitely create in Azure.

### Virtual Network
- IP Subnets are organized in a virtual network.
- One or more virtual network and each virtual network could contain one or more subnets.

### Virtual network gateway
- Virtual networks can access each other and be connected to on-premise solution using virtual network gateway.

### Load balancer 
- external to internal communication 
- Load Balancers can be used to balance load.

# Virtual Private Network
- a secure connection to a networking env through an unsecure connection. 
- Users need to access their resources, they need to go through VPN.

Two kind of VPNs
-----------------
----- Site to Site VPN
----- Point to Site VPN.

Express Route Circuit
---------------------
Dedicated Network Link
- Private: on premise datacenter to azure dedicated physical link. Supported telecom provider provides the link.
- Public: 
- Microsoft: office 365 subscription. Ex: dedicated link between office 365 and azure.

Virtual Network accessible from Internet
----------------------------------------
We'll need to create a public IP Adress.
